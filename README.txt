This is my final project for the class. My goal is to design a chat room with HTML, CSS, express, mongodb, and possibly socket.io. 

UPDATE 4/1/2018

I am still struggling with socket.io, might need to find another way to do this.

UPDATE 4/2/2018

I have decided to scrap the socket.io idea and just include an update button to pull new messages. Not ideal but probably the only way I will get this to work.
